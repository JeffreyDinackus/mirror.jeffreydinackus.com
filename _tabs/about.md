Matthew 7:7 - 7:8

Ask, Seek, Knock
7 â€œAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

Those who do everything in their power to succeed and therefore knock, will succeed. Those who give up will fail time and again. 

Read the Didache on this blog I highly reccomend it.
